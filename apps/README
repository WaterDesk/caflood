### APPS - directory ###

The "apps" directory contains the all applications that need to use
the CAAPI in order to be build.

There should be one sub-directory for each application,
i.e. game_of_life sub-directory. Only apps that have their code as
sub-directory can be build with the CAAPI.

Howver, it is possible to have an external application in a different
directory, i.e. reside in a different location of the hard disk.  In
order to compile this external app with CAAPI, a symbolic link into the
app sub-directory that link to the "apps" directory must exist.

In a Windows operating system you can use the following command with
PowerShell as administrator (notice the use of /J to create a
junction):

PS > cmd /c mklink /J "link" target

In a Unix operating system (Linux) you can use the follwoing command:

$ ln -s target link
