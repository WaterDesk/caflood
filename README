### 1. About CADDIES and the CAAPI###

The CA Application Programming Interface (API) (Guidolin et~al., 2012)
of the CADDIES framework defines a standard set of methods, data
structures and variables that can be used to develop parallel CA
algorithms. The main idea of the CA API is that a developer needs to
write the code of the CA model only once. After that, the CA API give
the flexibility to produce the same CA model for any type of CA grid,
square/hexagonal/triangular grid, and to use different high
performance acceleration techniques without changing the code or with
minimum effort.
